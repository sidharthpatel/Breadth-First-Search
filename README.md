# Breadth-First-Search
Breadth First Search is a program that is based on an algorithm for traversing and searching graph data structures where you start from a selected, root node and traverse the graph thus exploring the neighbor nodes returning the shortest path from point A to B.

### Features
- [x] Generated a Graph based on a Array List data structure.
- [x] Built an application capable of generating randomized maps with distances from one city to another city using the Graph.
- [x] Implemented the breadth-first-search (BFS) algorithm searching for the shortest path between cities.


### Notes
Description of any challenges encountered while building the application:
- Generating the Graph while keeping program complexity in mind.
- Ensuring that a valid randomized, weighted graph is generated.
